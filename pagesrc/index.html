      <h2><span>What is "Cool Stars"?</span></h2>
      <p>
	The Cambridge Workshop on Cool Stars, Stellar Systems, and the Sun ("Cool Stars") has been running for 37 years. The first workshop was held in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1980.
	Since then, Cool Stars has been held largely biennially, alternating between North America and Europe, where approximately 400 international experts in Low-Mass Stars, Solar Physics, and Exoplanets meet to exchange ideas in a cross-disciplinary and friendly environment.
      </p>
      <p>
	Four institutions in the Boston area (Boston University, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (Harvard College Observatory / Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory), MIT, and University of Massachusetts Lowell) jointly organize Cool Stars 20 which will be held at Boston University in Boston/Cambridge, MA from July 29 to August 03, 2018.

We will not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Please follow these guidelines:</p>

It also includes offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, or religion.</li>
	    <li>All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience of people from many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate.</li>
	    <li>Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees.</li>
	   </ul>

	  <p>Participants asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

The full <a href="docs/CS20_code_of_conduct.pdf">Cool Stars 20 Code of Conduct</a> is available as pdf.</p>
